-For the withdrawals and deposits, consider giving the user and affirmation that the transaction went through by printing the new balance.
-Really like that the it writes once the program as completely closed. Very clean.

-Second reviewer: Your code was clean and semi easy to follow, the program ran great with no problems. Also, i like what you did with the random num generator by commenting it out so it only prints one account number (clever). one thing i did notice and its just being nit picky, is that in the printed file the balances seem a bit over tabbed and dont line up. Also, i think Dean is more badass becuse he's practically a demon still i believe, i still gotta catch up with some of the newer episodes.

-#3: The program worked very nicely and was very user friendly.  I tried to break it a little but wasn't successful.  What happens if the user enters monetary values of $10.124, for example?  Looks like maybe the amount is rounded?
Main class is super clean and simple.  Clients and Accounts look very logical and accomplish the required tasks with minimal code.
Looks like you are working on creating a private version of the account number with asterisks.  That would be a cool addition.  Were you having trouble getting it to work?
Good job!

-#4: Everything looked nice and worked as it was supposed to! The colors of the program make it much more fun to use :)  Since we don't need string builders now, they did seem unnecessary. Can't think of any improvements, but I though you code was very methodical and easy to read as well.
